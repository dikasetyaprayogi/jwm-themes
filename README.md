# what is jwm ?

JWM (Joe's window manager) is a lightweight window manager for the X11 Window System.
https://joewing.net/projects/jwm/

## why use jwm ?

because it is lightweight and modular. basic jwm windowing system would take 15mb or less.
an example my jwm vizta theme with transparency and basic multimedia usage takes ~200mb ram / ~300mb ram (with cache).
