**what is jwm ?**

[JWM](https://joewing.net/projects/jwm/) (Joe's window manager) is a lightweight window manager for the X11 Window System.


**why jwm ?**

because it is lightweight and modular. a basic jwm runs on average 15mb or less. here an example of my hyperbola gnu linux desktop with transparent jwm vizta theme and basic multimedia usage takes ~200mb ram / ~300mb ram (with cache).

**usage of this repository**

you can import theme files with jwmkit or inspenct the reference inside the theme and integrate into your jwm config yourself. you might use gpick to recustomize color easily. you also need picom for transparency and shadow effect.
