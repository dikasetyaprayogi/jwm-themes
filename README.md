# what is jwm ?

JWM (Joe's window manager) is a lightweight window manager for the X11 Window System.
https://joewing.net/projects/jwm/

## why use jwm ?

because it is lightweight and modular. basic jwm windowing system would take 15mb or less.
an example my jwm vizta theme with transparency and basic multimedia usage takes ~200mb ram / ~300mb ram (with cache).

## usage of this repository

you can import theme files with jwmkit or inspenct the reference inside the theme and integrate into your jwm config yourself. you might use gpick to recustomize color easily. you also need picom for transparency and shadow effect.
